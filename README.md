## Game
The rules are simple, align 5 stones of your color or capture 10 opponent's stones to win the game.   
The game is played on a 19x19 Goban, without limit to the number of stones.   
To capture a pair of your opponentâ€™s stones and remove them from the board, flank them with your own stones.   
A player that manages to align five stones only wins if the opponent can not break this alignment by capturing a pair.     
It is forbidden to play a move that introduces two free-three alignments, which would guarantee a win by alignment.
